# craphill, an attempt of fixing the infamous good hill src
since i have some php skills and used to work on this src,<br> i've decided to make some work "easier" for script kiddies who literally can't learn brick hill's design.<br><br>
this goes to such people as: topher7lol, explorer, maybe robin maybe not <br>and even you, if you couldn't do anything to it or you're just trying to learn php by this.<br>
as a small reminder - i tried to fix all of this thing for <b>3 days</b> and not for 2 weeks unlike topher.<br>
# recommendations:
1. screw this source
2. start learning php normally, as since this is a "homework". Nothing else.
3. do not take this serious nor use it for production (script kiddies may skip this one)
4. respect the original source developers (me, anarchy(now quack), other builder land site dev (can't remember his name) )

## fixes and additional features, welcome to the fun zone.
1. Forums.<br>(now they have a normal design unlike in cyberworld, fixed some important parts of forum usage - my threads, replying, creating threads etc.)
2. Admin Panel.<br>(instead of an awful 2017-like page, now you can have fun w/ mopaiv-like admin panel with some additional stuff)<br>
3. /panel/site-settings.<br>(dear topher7lol, if you reading this, take this as a shame on you)
4. Simple news implementation.<br>(can be seen at the dashboard)
5. Some design fixes.<br>(i have no idea to tell on this one, but the site looks quite better now)

### additional stuff to tell:
i as thedenbruh take no responsibility on what are you gonna do<br> 
with this source, therefore you should worry about the consequences of such usage but not me.
